Recursive structure
  we use hardlinks for development to ensure consistency
  
Sub-command executables like 'helper'
  end user only, not part of the framework
  are identical to groan (the master implementation)
  
Command subcommands like 'help.sub.cmd.sh'
  also have identical implementation
  name is obtained form the script name
  looks for a folder with the same name ../$name
  
Misc: Code removed which looks like it might be useful:

#selfLocation="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null && pwd )"
#$DEBUG && echo "dispatching-command location: $selfLocation"
